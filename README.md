# Stabler-Leadbeater Apothecary AR Project
This project is a proof of concept for the Alexandria Stabler-Leadbeater Apothecary museum, to demonstrate a possible application of AR into their museum, specifically a poppyseed exhibit.
# Notes:
 - 3d models are displayed using the .gltf file format
 - A "hiro" preset marker is required to display the ar content
# Future Changes:
 - More Exhibits
 - Different marker
 - Better UI/UX
