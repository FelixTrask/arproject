# Stabler-Leadbeater Apothecary AR Project
This project is a proof of concept for the Alexandria Stabler-Leadbeater Apothecary museum, to demonstrate a possible application of AR into their museum, specifically a poppyseed exhibit.
## Notes:
 - A working webcam/phone camera is needed to view the ar content
 - A "hiro" preset marker is required to display the ar content
 - 3d models are displayed using the .gltf file format
## Future Changes:
 - More Mobile-friendly
 - More Exhibits
 - Different marker
 - Better UI/UX
